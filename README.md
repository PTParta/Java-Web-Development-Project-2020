Helsinki University Web Server Programming Java course project

Languages / frameworks used in this project are

  - Twitter Bootstrap
  
The website is hosted by Heroku: https://ancient-bayou-73135.herokuapp.com

In this course project the task was to create a "LinkedIn" website.

The website consists of the following pages:

Wall
  - The userÂ´s personal wall where he/she can add skills
    and others can commend those skills.

Connections
  - Send, accept, decline connection requests to / from other users.
  - Search people.

Feed
  - Write posts and comment posts from other users that you have
    made a connection with.

Most of the time in this project was used to make the back end
work and the front end looks a bit rude.

Improvements that could be made to the project are:
  - make the front end more appealing
  - optimize the back end
  - refactor both Java and HTML files
